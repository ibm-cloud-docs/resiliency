It begins by identifying critical assets and their dependencies, for instance, a Minimum Viable Company (MVC) concept defines a functional level of service which can continue to serve customers during disruptions.

For workloads deployed on IBM Cloud, this inventory includes application images, configurations, data, and the dependent cloud services and infrastructure required to operate them at the needed scale. You should also familiarise yourself with the [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities](shared responsibilities) between IBM Cloud and customers for running workloads on IBM Cloud.
