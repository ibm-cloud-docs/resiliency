# Understanding cyber resiliency
{: #cyber-resiliency-overview}

Cyber resilience is part of an organization's capability to prevent, withstand and recover from cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware attacks and other malicious actions. 

Protection against such threats should be a 2-pronged approach: cyber security focusses on preventing the attacks in the first place, while cyber resiliency focuses on prevailing in the event of a cyber breach. In an environment where threats and threat actors are continuously evolving, adopting a secure-by-design approach is essential to prepare for the inevitability of an attack. Business continuity planning in these scenarios should prioritize the safe and secure restoration of critical applications and infrastructure to maintain operational stability.

## What's the difference between cyber resiliency and disaster recovery?
{: #cyber-dr-difference}

While both cyber resiliency and disaster recovery deal with recovering from backups, their goals differ significantly and this drives different requirements, processes, tools and techniques needed. It is beneficial to consider cyber resiliency as the third and distinct pillar from backup and disaster recovery of your operational resiliency. Some of the significant differences are

* Nature: Unlike disasters, which are typically random natural events, cyberattacks are targeted, well-planned, and engineered for maximum impact.
* [Recovery Point Objective](#x3429911){: term} (RPO) considerations: While disaster recovery aims at reducing RPO and returning services with minimum data loss, some effects of cyberattacks might be latent, and so the recovery point is not always known. The goal is to restore to a clean state even if it would mean a greater RPO and data loss.
* Backup copies: Ransomware attacks are known to target backup copies, either destroying or corrupting them. Unlike disaster recovery, the latest backup copy might be inappropriate for cyber resiliency. Follow an enhanced version of the 3-2-1 backup rule, called 3-2-1-1-0. This means you maintain three copies of data, with two stored on different types of media, one in a separate location, and another kept offline to provide a physical air-gap. Additionally, at least one backup is verified to be error-free, ensuring a reliable recovery point. The offline copy helps protect against cyber threats, while the error-free backup ensures successful data recovery when needed.
* Isolation: A valid recovery point means that we periodically restore and test backups for recoverability in a clean and isolated environment to help ensure that any malicious code does not affect the rest of the environment. Forensic analysis to analyze the extent of the attack and the threat vector itself might need a separate isolated environment.
