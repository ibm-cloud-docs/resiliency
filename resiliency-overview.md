# Understanding resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #resiliency-overview}

In information technology (IT), resiliency is broadly defined as the ability of an organization or solution to maintain essential systems and applications and to recover from disruptions. Resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} focuses on the perspective of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} clients, their solution planners, architects, and builders and the resilient solutions that they create on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform.

Resiliency requirements and capabilities must be considered according to the application or solution criticality for an organization. As tolerance for downtime decreases, resiliency ensures that businesses are able to continue operations, according to their requirements or Service Level Objectives. See also [Service Level Objectives](slo.md).

Resiliency is a shared responsibity between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and clients building solutions and taking advantage of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services provide the components of the solution and guarantee their resiliency according to their SLAs, while clients are responsible for putting the components together in resilient configurations that achieve their SLOs. For more information, see [Shared Responsibility Model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities){: external}.


The following guide provides an overview of basic concepts and capabilities, including high availability, disaster recovery, cyber resiliency, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} assurances in these areas. You can find everything that you need to help you design, plan, test, and support operational resiliency regulations for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solutions. Get a general view of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resiliency capabilities, which can be used with your solutions, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service-specific capabilities from the services own documentation.

For a broader view of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} resiliency, see the [IBM Well-Architected Framework](https://www.ibm.com/architectures/well-architected/resiliency){: external}.
