# Resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #resiliency-overview}

In information technology (IT), resiliency is broadly defined as the ability of an organization or solution to maintain essential systems and applications and to recover from disruptions. Resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} focuses on the perspective of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} clients, their solution planners, architects, and builders and the resilient solutions that they create on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform.

Resiliency requirements and capabilities must be considered according to how critical the application or solution is for an organization. As tolerance for downtime decreases, resiliency helps ensure that businesses can continue operations according to their requirements or service level objectives (SLOs). For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service level objectives](/docs/resiliency?topic=resiliency-slo).

Resiliency is a shared responsibility between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and clients that build solutions with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services provide the components of the solution and guarantee their resiliency according to their [Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](/docs/overview?topic=overview-slas). Clients are responsible for putting the components together in resilient configurations that achieve their SLOs. For more information, see [Shared responsibilities for using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} products](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities){: external}.

The following guide provides an overview of basic concepts and capabilities, including high availability, disaster recovery, cyber resiliency, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} assurances in these areas. You can find everything that you need to help you design, plan, test, and support operational resiliency regulations for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solutions. Get a general view of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resiliency capabilities and best practices, which you can use with your solutions, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service-specific capabilities from the services own documentation.

For a broader view of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} resiliency, see the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Well-Architected Framework](https://www.ibm.com/architectures/well-architected/resiliency){: external}.
