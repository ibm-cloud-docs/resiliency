# Resiliency Solution Guide Overview 
{: #resiliency-overview}

In Information Technology, Resiliency is broadly defined as the ability of an organization or solution to maintain essential systems and applications and to recover from disruptions.

In this guide, we focus on Resiliency from the perspective of our IBM Cloud clients, their Solution Planners, Architects and Builders and the resilient solutions they create on our platform. 

We provide an overview of basic concepts and capabilities, including High Availability, Disaster Recovery and Cyber Resiliency, and IBM Cloud assurances in these areas; cover planning aspects of these practices and also how to test resiliency in your solutions.

This guide is designed as one stop shop for your resiliency needs, helping you in your journey to designing, implementing and supporting operational resiliency regulations for your IBM Cloud solutions. It provides a general view IBM Cloud Platform resiliency capabilities which can be used on your solutions, and refers to IBM Cloud service specific capabilities in their own documentation.

For an IBM broader view of Resiliency, refer to the IBM Well-Architected Framework: https://www.ibm.com/architectures/well-architected/resiliency
