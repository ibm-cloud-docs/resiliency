# Understanding resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #resiliency-overview}

In Information Technology, resiliency is broadly defined as the ability of an organization or solution to maintain essential systems and applications and to recover from disruptions. Resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} focuses on the perspective of our clients, their solution planners, architects, and builders and the resilient solutions they create on our platform.

We provide an overview of basic concepts and capabilities, including high availability, disaster recovery and cyber resiliency, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} assurances in these areas. This guide is designed as one stop shop for your resiliency needs to help in your journey to designing, implementing, testing, and supporting operational resiliency regulations for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solutions. It provides a general view of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resiliency capabilities which can be used on your solutions, and refers to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service specific capabilities in their own documentation.
