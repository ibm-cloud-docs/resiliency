# Understanding resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #resiliency-overview}

In information technology (IT), resiliency is broadly defined as the ability of an organization or solution to maintain essential systems and applications and to recover from disruptions. Resiliency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} focuses on the perspective of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} clients, their solution planners, architects, and builders and the resilient solutions that they create on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform.

The following guide provides an overview of basic concepts and capabilities, including high availability, disaster recovery, cyber resiliency, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} assurances in these areas. You can find everything that you need to help you design, implement, test, and support operational resiliency regulations for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solutions. Get a general view of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resiliency capabilities, which can be used with your solutions, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service-specific capabilities from the services own documentation.
