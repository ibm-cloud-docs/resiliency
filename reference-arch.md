# Reference Architecture Patterns

Reference Architecture patterns are industry standard solutions, that are reusable and for solving common and recurring problems across different business domains. Resiliency patterns on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offer standard recovery solutions from adverse conditions while performing the operations and maintainance of the workloads across the zones, regions and globally. 

The table provides you with standard resiliency patterns based on the workloads and are grouped based on concepts of high availability and disaster recovery
